Author Neil Caplan helps readers understand the complexities and contradictions of the conflict and why the histories of Palestine and Israel are so fiercely contested.</p> <p>Now in its second edition, this book has been thoroughly updated to reflect the events that have transpired since its original publication. Fresh insights consider the impact of current global and regional instability and violence on the prospects of peace and reconciliation. New discussions address recent debates over two-state versus one-state solutions, growing polarization in public discourse outside of the Middle East, the role of public intellectuals, and the growing trend of merging scholarship with advocacy. Part of the Wiley-Blackwell <i>Contested Histories</i> series, this clear and accessible volume:</p> <ul> <li>Offers a balanced, non-polemic approach to current academic discussions and political debates on the Israel-Palestine conflict</li> <li>Highlights eleven core arguments viewed by the author as unwinnable</li> <li>Encourages readers to go beyond simply assigning blame in the conflict</li> <li>Explores the major historiographical debates arising from the dispute</li> <li>Includes updated references and additional maps</li> </ul> <p>Already a standard text for courses on the history and politics of the Middle East, <i>The Israel-Palestine Conflict </i>is an indispensable resource for students, scholars, and interested general readers.</p>', 'NOT_MATURE', '0.2.2.0.preview.1', 'en', NULL, '["History / Middle East / General","History / General"]', 'm7FlpegnYrw', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DM-mDwAAQBAJ', 384, '"BOOK"', '1119523877', '9781119523871', NULL, '["Neil Caplan"]', '[{"name":"Neil Caplan","key":"OL4597719A","k_id":3}]', 'the-irael-paletine-conflict', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:39:51', '2023-11-05 08:39:53'),

Despite having little association with one another, these photographers developed remarkably similar visions of nature. They rode a wave of interest in wilderness imagery and made pictures that were hung in settler drawing rooms, perused in albums, projected in theaters, and re-created on vacations. In both the American West and the Tasman World, landscape photography fed into settler belonging and produced new ways of thinking about territory and history. During this key period of settler revolution, a generation of photographers came to associate “nature” with remoteness, antiquity, and emptiness, a perspective that disguised the realities of Indigenous presence and reinforced colonial fantasies of environmental abundance. This book lifts the work of these photographers out of their provincial contexts and repositions it within a new comparative frame.', 'NOT_MATURE', '0.0.1.0.preview.1', 'en', NULL, '["History / Australia & New Zealand","History / North America","Nature / Environmental Conservation & Protection","Photography / History","Photography / Subjects & Themes / Landscapes","Political Science / Colonialism & Post-Colonialism","Sports & Recreation / History"]', '1tqWBW/6ZXQ', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iCWCEAAAQBAJ', 352, '"BOOK"', '0520381262', '9780520381261', NULL, '["Jarrod Hore"]', '[{"name":"Jarrod Hore","key":"OL9991600A","k_id":19}]', 'visions-of-nature', 1, NULL, 4, 0, '2023-11-05 08:43:39', '2023-12-05 12:44:16'),

General review of the symposium Organized by the Chair of Taxonomy and Ecology of the University „Babe -Bolyai” (Cluj-Napoca, Romania), in co-operation with the Romanian Society of Phytosociology and the International Federation of Phytosociology, this international symposium was dedicated to Prof. dr. h.c. Franco PEDROTTI th (University of Camerino, Italy), on the occasion of his 70 birthday. Drawn from four continents, the 84 participants (of whom over 50% were young people under 35 years old) represented 12 countries: Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, UK and USA, thus covering a large part of Earth’s bio-geographical regions. The opening ceremony took place in the University’s imposing Aula Magna and included two welcome speeches on behalf of the Rector and the President of the Nature Monument Committee, a Laudatio to Prof. F. Pedrotti and a short folk music recital. The symposium programme was composed of two plenary sessions, four short communication sessions (divided into two sections: A – General aspects of nature protection; B – Nature conservation in practice) and a poster session.

He spent his youth in rural Holland, and the country\'s flat landscapes, trees, flowers, and birds would feature in his early art. After he moved to Paris, he encountered new radical thinking about art and humanity\'s changing relationship with nature. Later, in Provence and Auvers, he discovered unfamiliar terrain, flora, and fauna that further influenced his artistic ideas and subject matter. Van Gogh\'s images of such diverse environments reflect not only his immediate surroundings but also the artist\'s evolving engagement with nature and art. <p><i>Van Gogh and Nature</i> is an eye-opening and beautifully produced catalogue, which accompanied the best-attended special exhibition in the Clark Art Institute\'s history. It chronicles the artist\'s ongoing relationship with nature throughout his entire career. Among the featured works are Van Gogh\'s drawings and paintings, along with related materials that illuminate his reading, sources, and influences. Vivid color photography and explanatory texts based on new research by the authors clarify a central theme of Van Gogh\'s oeuvre. <p>Distributed for the Clark Art Institute <br><p> <br>Exhibition Schedule: </p><p><b>Clark Art Institute</b><br> (06/14/15-09/13/15)</p>', 'NOT_MATURE', 'preview-1.0.0', 'en', NULL, '["ART / Collections, Catalogs, Exhibitions / General","Art / Individual Artists / Monographs","Art / Subjects & Themes / Landscapes & Seascapes","Art / Subjects & Themes / Plants & Animals"]', 'FS0LiaAS81Q', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zl4AogEACAAJ', 236, '"BOOK"', '0300210299', '9780300210293', NULL, '["Richard Kendall","Sjraar van Heugten","Chris Stolwijk"]', '[{"name":"Richard Kendall","key":"OL226572A","k_id":23},{"name":"Sjraar van Heugten","key":"OL81305A","k_id":25},{"name":"Chris Stolwijk","key":"OL88938A","k_id":26}]', 'van-gogh-and-nature', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:43:42', '2023-11-05 08:43:48'),

Also considered are the ways in which animals have been regarded by science, literature, and the environmentalist movement. A striking meditation on women and wolves is presented, as is an examination of sexual harassment and the taxonomy of hunters and hunting.

Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of "identity" with a gender-determined subjectivity.

As a contemporary novelist, Fowles began as a modernist self-consciously aware of the various narratological problems that he encountered throughout his writings. In his most recent novel, A Maggot, however, he assumes the role of the postmodernist who not only subverts the tradition of narratology, but also poses a series of problems concerning history and politics. Throughout this study, Mahmoud Salami attempts to locate Fowles\'s fiction in the context of modern critical theory and narrative poetics. He provides a lively analysis of the ways in which Fowles deliberately deployed realistic historical narrative in order to subvert them from within the very conventions they seek to transgress, and he examines these subversive techniques and the challenges they pose to the tradition of narratology. Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader\'s position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant\'s Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles\'s nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society. Indeed, Fowles emerges as a postmodernist novelist committed to the underprivileged, to social democracy, and to literary pluralism. This study clearly illustrates the fact that Fowles is a poststructuralist--let alone a postmodernist--in many ways: in his treatment of narratives, in mixing history with narrative fiction and philosophy, and in his appeal for freedom and for social and literary pluralism. It significantly contributes to a better understanding of Fowles\'s problematical narratives, which can only be properly understood if treated within the fields of modern critical theory, narratology, and the poetics of postmodernism.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.3.5.0.preview.3', 'en', NULL, NULL, 'vf48CQkUm6w', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EquizXeXb3kC', 302, '"BOOK"', '083863446X', '9780838634462', NULL, '["Mahmoud Salami"]', '[{"name":"Mahmoud Salami","key":"OL895065A","k_id":43}]', 'john-fowless-fiction-and-the-poetics-of-postmodernism', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:47:19', '2023-11-05 08:47:21'),

With 1200 photographs, sketches, and diagrams, the book  provides unbridled access to every aspect of the film-making process. It tells the stories behind each individual film and covers the design and technology behind all the astounding effects. This book pays homage to how one film became eight, how a few months became a decade, and how one author’s fantasy became the project of many individuals’ lifetimes-told by the people who were there, the people who made the magic real. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded will start from the very beginning, describing how the book was optioned, the casting of Harry, Ron and Hermione, and the assembling of a creative team with the vision to tackle a world we had previously seen only in our imaginations. Interviews, quotes, and stories from the directors, producers, screenwriters, and actors discuss the making of all eight films at length, including the last film, film number 8, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2. Daniel Radcliffe and his personal narrative from set to set is used as the life line that connects all aspects of this memoir, giving structure to the many voices of the Harry Potter family who orate this tale. All of the movies were filmed at the Leavesden Studio in Hertfordshire, England and these pages describe how the Leavesden family dealt with numerous cast, crew, and production dramas, replacements, technical difficulties and countless narrative and visual decisions. This book will touch on subjects such as J.K. Rowling’s private comments to her young cast, the impact of Richard Harris’ (the original Dumbledore) death on the cast and crew, the effects of 9/11 on the Leavesden family (during the filming of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the reality of "growing up Potter" for the young starlets who experienced their adolescence on a hugely public stage, and reflections from the cast and crew on the end of the film series. In addition to stories on and off set, Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded pays tribute to the stunning physical, visual and technological genius that went into making an unbelievable story believable, showcasing more than a decade’s worth of art and special effects, including never-before-seen photos of the costumes, sets, props, and creatures, as well as early concept art, drawings and designs. The book is fully supported by Warner Bros. and is being put together with the same group as Harry Potter Film Wizardry: The Updated Edition. While Film Wizardry provided a whimsical and informative scrapbook for Harry Potter fans and was published prior to the release of the last film, this mammoth book gives readers a more complete account of the entire film-making process, designed in a more classical, sophisticated package. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded is a publishing event.

I quickly closed it and felt the radiator: completely cold. I had no idea why Grandpa would have shut off the heat and opened the window.</p> <p>Upstairs I could hear Hugh still calling and opening and closing doors, obviously looking for Grandpa. My sense of dread increased still further, and I was just about to turn around and go upstairs when my eye caught something through the French door into the dining room. It was dark in there, too, but the windows were visible as bright rectangles, and in front of one of them stood a tall, gangly figure. It kind of looked like Grandpa, except I didn\'\'t remember him being that thin.</p> <p>I went and opened the door, but the man by the window didn\'\'t move as I entered the room. I could tell he had his back to me, as though he had gone to look out the window and then fallen into a trance.</p> <p>"Grandpa?" I asked low, not wanting to scare him.</p> <p>No reaction.</p> <p>Suddenly, I got a very strange feeling that the man wasn\'\'t my Grandpa. I know it\'\'s totally silly-I mean, who else could it be?</p> <p>I squinted my eyes in an effort to see his features more clearly, and I realized to my astonishment he was naked except for a pair of white undies.</p> <p>I\'\'m not kidding. I know I should have felt embarrassed, but for some reason it just made me even more uneasy. Something was definitely not right.</p> <p>"Grandpa?" I said, louder.</p> <p>Still, the man didn\'\'t stir. I noticed the faint whisper of the wind blowing through the room, and I noticed the windows in here were also standing ajar.</p> <p>Finally, it dawned on me to turn on the lights. I can\'\'t believe I didn\'\'t think of it earlier, but the situation was just so unreal and I was really confused and scared. I found the switch and flicked it.</p> <p>At long last, the man by the window reacted and started turning slowly around. I gaped at him. It was my Grandpa all right, but I almost didn\'\'t recognize him. His cheeks were hollow, his lips thin and dry, the skin around his eyes was very dark, the eyes themselves were really haunting, being way too dark, like almost black, as though the pupils had grown to blot out the white.</p> <p>There was something strange above his head, too, although it must have been the shadows playing a trick on me-but for a brief second, I could have sworn Grandpa had a couple of branches sticking out of the top of his skull. Yeah, I know. It sounds completely bonkers.</p> <p>It was all over in a blink of an eye, then Grandpa looked exactly like I remembered him-the only odd thing about him being the missing clothes.</p> <p>"Well, if it isn\'\'t Otha," he said, his face lighting up. "I was just wondering when you guys would show up."

These approaches range from that of creating a mathematical model of the decision situation under consideration, as in operations research and other forms of mathematical decision analysis, to those that are based on human and organizational behavior. Recently, those working in the field have begun to combine approaches to the study of decision situations that arise in organizations, in our personal lives and in the communities in which we live. This book is an attempt to assist those concerned with decision making to work with this combination of approaches. In the past, decision problems have been considered according to the condi tions under which they arise and to some extent in terms of the approaches available for their resolution. Writers on the subject who are mathematically oriented have devised a method of classifying decisions based on the type of mathematics that they suggest be used in the resolution of the problems. This approach leads to the division of decision situations into the categories of cer tainty, uncertainty, risk and competition.

Introductory material receives a fresh treatment, with an emphasis on Boolean subgames and the Rudin-Keisler order as unifying concepts. Advanced material focuses on the surprisingly wide variety of properties related to the weightedness of a game.<br><br><br> A desirability relation orders the individuals or coalitions of a game according to their influence in the corresponding voting system. As Taylor and Zwicker show, acyclicity of such a relation approximates weightedness--the more sensitive the relation, the closer the approximation. A trade is an exchange of players among coalitions, and robustness under such trades is equivalent to weightedness of the game. Robustness under trades that fit some restrictive exchange pattern typically characterizes a wider class of simple games--for example, games for which some particular desirability order is acyclic. Finally, one can often describe these wider classes of simple games by weakening the total additivity of a weighting to obtain what is called a pseudoweighting.

To help define the challenges and dilemmas confronting governments around the world, this book includes case studies from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. They show that, like other economic sectors, prostitution has well organized and highly diversified structures, and involves complex economic relations that give it the dimensions of an industry. In addition to its economic bases, prostitution has social components relating to unequal relations between men and women, as well as between children and parents. The national studies show that the circumstances of those in prostitution range from freely chosen and remunerative employment to debt bondage and virtual slavery. The different modes of entry into the sector, and the possibility of making a distinction between voluntary and coerced prostitution, help explain why it is difficult for policymakers and legislators to define a clear legal stance on adult prostitution, or to implement effective social programs. A chapter on child prostitution shows clearly that it constitutes a serious human rights violation and an intolerable form of child labor.</p>', 'MATURE', '0.10.7.0.preview.1', 'en', NULL, '["Business & Economics / Economic Conditions","Business & Economics / Labor / General","Political Science / General","Political Science / Public Policy / Social Security","Psychology / Human Sexuality","Social Science / General","Social Science / Sociology / General","Social Science / Prostitution & Sex Trade"]', 'VJWI6uWasB4', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VFNKZbL1jWwC', 232, '"BOOK"', '9221095223', '9789221095224', NULL, '["Lin Lean Lim"]', '[{"name":"Lin Lean Lim","key":"OL3205432A","k_id":76}]', 'the-sex-sector', 1, NULL, 1, 0, '2024-02-17 09:21:48', '2024-02-17 09:21:51'),

Through an analysis of masculinities as social assemblages, the study shows how affective health problems are tied to modern individualism rather than African ‘tradition’ that has become a cliché in Eurocentric gender studies. Affective health is conceptualized as a balancing act between autonomy and connectivity that after colonialism and apartheid has become compromised through the imperative of self-reliance. This book provides a rare perspective on young men’s vulnerability in everyday life that may affect the reader and spark discussion about how masculinities in relationships shape physical and psychological health.

These strategies minimise the need for cumbersome cabling, thereby reducing costs. However, applying them involves the challenge of handling stochastic network delays, which can degrade control performance. To address this problem, commonly used simple PID could be employed. However, PID suffers from gain range limitations when used in a delayed environment. Furthermore, model-based controllers are complex and require exact models of the process and systematic system identification for implementation. </p> <p>Therefore, to address these issues, the book proposes control strategies that retain the simplicity of PID in terms of ease of tuning and structure, while improving on the performance of the closed-loop system with regard to stochastic network delays and mismatches. Concretely, it proposes and discusses three strategies, namely: Setpoint Weighting (SW), Filtered Predictive PI (FPPI) and Optimal Fuzzy PID. In order to optimise some of these controllers, two novel hybrid optimisation algorithms combining the dynamism of the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) and advantages of both the Spiral Dynamic Algorithm (SDA) and the Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimisation (APSO) have been used. The strategies proposed here can also be applied in stochastic control scenarios (not necessarily wireless) characterised by uncertainties. </p> This book will be useful to engineers and researchers in both industry and academia. In industry, it will be particularly useful to research and development efforts where PID controllers and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) involving both short and long term stochastic network delay are employed. Thus, it can be used for real-time control design in these areas. In the academic setting, the book will be useful for researchers, undergraduate and graduate students of instrumentation and control. It can also be used as reference material for teaching courses on predictive and adaptive controls and their application.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.1.1.0.preview.3', 'en', NULL, '["Technology & Engineering / Automation","Technology & Engineering / Telecommunications","Technology & Engineering / Engineering (General)","Technology & Engineering / Electrical","Computers / Artificial Intelligence / General"]', 'jvJRkwA45yo', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/P9TkDwAAQBAJ', 154, '"BOOK"', '3030477371', '9783030477370', NULL, '["Sabo Miya Hassan","Rosdiazli Ibrahim","Nordin Saad","Kishore Bingi","Vijanth Sagayan Asirvadam"]', NULL, 'hybrid-pid-based-predictive-control-strategies-for-wirelesshart-networked-control-systems', 0, NULL, 1, 0, '2024-02-18 06:37:29', '2024-02-18 06:37:29'),

Ten years ago, integrated circuit (IC) designers were content to use the computer for circuit, logic, and limited amounts of high-level simulation, as well as for capturing the digitized mask layouts used for IC manufacture. The tools were only aids to design-the designer could always find a way to implement the chip or board manually if the tools failed or if they did not give acceptable results. Today, however, design technology plays an indispensable role in the design ofelectronic systems and is critical to achieving time-to-market, cost, and performance targets. In less than ten years, designers have come to rely on automatic or semi automatic CAD systems for the physical design ofcomplex ICs containing over a million transistors. In the past three years, practical logic synthesis systems that take into account both cost and performance have become a commercial reality and many designers have already relinquished control ofthe logic netlist level of design to automatic computer aids. To date, only in certain well-defined areas, especially digital signal process ing and telecommunications. have higher-level design methods and tools found significant success.

Records of English Court Music (a series of seven volumes covering the period 1485-1714) is the first attempt to compile a systematic calendar of such references. It aims to revise these earlier studies where necessary, adding significant details which researchers omitted, clarifying the context of documents and substituting current call-marks for defunct references. Volume V is primarily concerned with the post-Restoration years already partially covered in volumes I and II. The material from the Exchequer and Declared Accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber has been revised to include references to trumpeters and drummers. Other sections are devoted to material outside the Lord Chamberlain\'s papers: the Signet Office Docquet Books, Secret Service accounts and more from the Exchequer; the Corporation of Musick (controlled by the Court musicians) and to the range of music material from accounts of the Receivers General. Samples from the comprehensive records of the Lord Steward\'s department (including those of the Cofferer of the Household) are also provided.
