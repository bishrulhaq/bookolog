He spent his youth in rural Holland, and the country\'s flat landscapes, trees, flowers, and birds would feature in his early art. After he moved to Paris, he encountered new radical thinking about art and humanity\'s changing relationship with nature. Later, in Provence and Auvers, he discovered unfamiliar terrain, flora, and fauna that further influenced his artistic ideas and subject matter. Van Gogh\'s images of such diverse environments reflect not only his immediate surroundings but also the artist\'s evolving engagement with nature and art. <p><i>Van Gogh and Nature</i> is an eye-opening and beautifully produced catalogue, which accompanied the best-attended special exhibition in the Clark Art Institute\'s history. It chronicles the artist\'s ongoing relationship with nature throughout his entire career. Among the featured works are Van Gogh\'s drawings and paintings, along with related materials that illuminate his reading, sources, and influences.

Organized by five principal themes of a regional overview, politics, political economy, social contexts, and the international dimensions of Middle East issues, Interpreting the Middle East provides a vibrant introduction to the Middle East that is compatible with this regionalist perspective. Invited authorities contribute insightful and accessible original discussions of headline-fresh issues, including the aftermath of the Iraq war, Iran\'s regional ambitions, developments in the Israeli Palestinian conflict, and the global politics of Middle East oil, as well as the Islamic awakening, conflict in the Western Sahara, civil military relations, economic development, political change, and gender understandings.

Also considered are the ways in which animals have been regarded by science, literature, and the environmentalist movement. A striking meditation on women and wolves is presented, as is an examination of sexual harassment and the taxonomy of hunters and hunting.

Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of "identity" with a gender-determined subjectivity.

As a contemporary novelist, Fowles began as a modernist self-consciously aware of the various narratological problems that he encountered throughout his writings. In his most recent novel, A Maggot, however, he assumes the role of the postmodernist who not only subverts the tradition of narratology, but also poses a series of problems concerning history and politics. Throughout this study, Mahmoud Salami attempts to locate Fowles\'s fiction in the context of modern critical theory and narrative poetics. He provides a lively analysis of the ways in which Fowles deliberately deployed realistic historical narrative in order to subvert them from within the very conventions they seek to transgress, and he examines these subversive techniques and the challenges they pose to the tradition of narratology. Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader\'s position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant\'s Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles\'s nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society. Indeed, Fowles emerges as a postmodernist novelist committed to the underprivileged, to social democracy, and to literary pluralism. This study clearly illustrates the fact that Fowles is a poststructuralist--let alone a postmodernist--in many ways: in his treatment of narratives, in mixing history with narrative fiction and philosophy, and in his appeal for freedom and for social and literary pluralism. It significantly contributes to a better understanding of Fowles\'s problematical narratives, which can only be properly understood if treated within the fields of modern critical theory, narratology, and the poetics of postmodernism.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.3.5.0.preview.3', 'en', NULL, NULL, 'vf48CQkUm6w', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EquizXeXb3kC', 302, '"BOOK"', '083863446X', '9780838634462', NULL, '["Mahmoud Salami"]', '[{"name":"Mahmoud Salami","key":"OL895065A","k_id":43}]', 'john-fowless-fiction-and-the-poetics-of-postmodernism', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:47:19', '2023-11-05 08:47:21'),

With 1200 photographs, sketches, and diagrams, the book  provides unbridled access to every aspect of the film-making process. It tells the stories behind each individual film and covers the design and technology behind all the astounding effects. This book pays homage to how one film became eight, how a few months became a decade, and how one author’s fantasy became the project of many individuals’ lifetimes-told by the people who were there, the people who made the magic real. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded will start from the very beginning, describing how the book was optioned, the casting of Harry, Ron and Hermione, and the assembling of a creative team with the vision to tackle a world we had previously seen only in our imaginations. Interviews, quotes, and stories from the directors, producers, screenwriters, and actors discuss the making of all eight films at length, including the last film, film number 8, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2. Daniel Radcliffe and his personal narrative from set to set is used as the life line that connects all aspects of this memoir, giving structure to the many voices of the Harry Potter family who orate this tale. All of the movies were filmed at the Leavesden Studio in Hertfordshire, England and these pages describe how the Leavesden family dealt with numerous cast, crew, and production dramas, replacements, technical difficulties and countless narrative and visual decisions. This book will touch on subjects such as J.K. Rowling’s private comments to her young cast, the impact of Richard Harris’ (the original Dumbledore) death on the cast and crew, the effects of 9/11 on the Leavesden family (during the filming of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the reality of "growing up Potter" for the young starlets who experienced their adolescence on a hugely public stage, and reflections from the cast and crew on the end of the film series. In addition to stories on and off set, Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded pays tribute to the stunning physical, visual and technological genius that went into making an unbelievable story believable, showcasing more than a decade’s worth of art and special effects, including never-before-seen photos of the costumes, sets, props, and creatures, as well as early concept art, drawings and designs. The book is fully supported by Warner Bros. and is being put together with the same group as Harry Potter Film Wizardry: The Updated Edition. While Film Wizardry provided a whimsical and informative scrapbook for Harry Potter fans and was published prior to the release of the last film, this mammoth book gives readers a more complete account of the entire film-making process, designed in a more classical, sophisticated package. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded is a publishing event.

Ele foi levado, então, para a casa dos tios que nada tinham a ver com o sobrenatural. Pelo contrário. Até os 10 anos, Harry foi uma espécie de gata borralheira: maltratado pelos tios, herdava roupas velhas do primo gorducho, tinha óculos remendados e era tratado como um estorvo. No dia de seu aniversário de 11 anos, entretanto, ele parece deslizar por um buraco sem fundo, como o de Alice no país das maravilhas, que o conduz a um mundo mágico. Descobre sua verdadeira história e seu destino: ser um aprendiz de feiticeiro até o dia em que terá que enfrentar a pior força do mal, o homem que assassinou seus pais. O menino de olhos verde, magricela e desengonçado, tão habituado à rejeição, descobre, também, que é um herói no universo dos magos. Potter fica sabendo que é a única pessoa a ter sobrevivido a um ataque do tal bruxo do mal e essa é a causa da marca em forma de raio que ele carrega na testa.
