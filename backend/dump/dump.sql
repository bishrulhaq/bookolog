Drawn from four continents, the 84 participants (of whom over 50% were young people under 35 years old) represented 12 countries: Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, UK and USA, thus covering a large part of Earth’s bio-geographical regions. The opening ceremony took place in the University’s imposing Aula Magna and included two welcome speeches on behalf of the Rector and the President of the Nature Monument Committee, a Laudatio to Prof. F. Pedrotti and a short folk music recital. The symposium programme was composed of two plenary sessions, four short communication sessions (divided into two sections: A – General aspects of nature protection; B – Nature conservation in practice) and a poster session.

He spent his youth in rural Holland, and the country\'s flat landscapes, trees, flowers, and birds would feature in his early art. After he moved to Paris, he encountered new radical thinking about art and humanity\'s changing relationship with nature. Later, in Provence and Auvers, he discovered unfamiliar terrain, flora, and fauna that further influenced his artistic ideas and subject matter. Van Gogh\'s images of such diverse environments reflect not only his immediate surroundings but also the artist\'s evolving engagement with nature and art. <p><i>Van Gogh and Nature</i> is an eye-opening and beautifully produced catalogue, which accompanied the best-attended special exhibition in the Clark Art Institute\'s history. It chronicles the artist\'s ongoing relationship with nature throughout his entire career. Among the featured works are Van Gogh\'s drawings and paintings, along with related materials that illuminate his reading, sources, and influences. Vivid color photography and explanatory texts based on new research by the authors clarify a central theme of Van Gogh\'s oeuvre. <p>Distributed for the Clark Art Institute <br><p> <br>Exhibition Schedule: </p><p><b>Clark Art Institute</b><br> (06/14/15-09/13/15)</p>', 'NOT_MATURE', 'preview-1.0.0', 'en', NULL, '["ART / Collections, Catalogs, Exhibitions / General","Art / Individual Artists / Monographs","Art / Subjects & Themes / Landscapes & Seascapes","Art / Subjects & Themes / Plants & Animals"]', 'FS0LiaAS81Q', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zl4AogEACAAJ', 236, '"BOOK"', '0300210299', '9780300210293', NULL, '["Richard Kendall","Sjraar van Heugten","Chris Stolwijk"]', '[{"name":"Richard Kendall","key":"OL226572A","k_id":23},{"name":"Sjraar van Heugten","key":"OL81305A","k_id":25},{"name":"Chris Stolwijk","key":"OL88938A","k_id":26}]', 'van-gogh-and-nature', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:43:42', '2023-11-05 08:43:48'),

Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of "identity" with a gender-determined subjectivity.

As a contemporary novelist, Fowles began as a modernist self-consciously aware of the various narratological problems that he encountered throughout his writings. In his most recent novel, A Maggot, however, he assumes the role of the postmodernist who not only subverts the tradition of narratology, but also poses a series of problems concerning history and politics. Throughout this study, Mahmoud Salami attempts to locate Fowles\'s fiction in the context of modern critical theory and narrative poetics. He provides a lively analysis of the ways in which Fowles deliberately deployed realistic historical narrative in order to subvert them from within the very conventions they seek to transgress, and he examines these subversive techniques and the challenges they pose to the tradition of narratology. Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader\'s position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant\'s Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles\'s nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society. Indeed, Fowles emerges as a postmodernist novelist committed to the underprivileged, to social democracy, and to literary pluralism. This study clearly illustrates the fact that Fowles is a poststructuralist--let alone a postmodernist--in many ways: in his treatment of narratives, in mixing history with narrative fiction and philosophy, and in his appeal for freedom and for social and literary pluralism. It significantly contributes to a better understanding of Fowles\'s problematical narratives, which can only be properly understood if treated within the fields of modern critical theory, narratology, and the poetics of postmodernism.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.3.5.0.preview.3', 'en', NULL, NULL, 'vf48CQkUm6w', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EquizXeXb3kC', 302, '"BOOK"', '083863446X', '9780838634462', NULL, '["Mahmoud Salami"]', '[{"name":"Mahmoud Salami","key":"OL895065A","k_id":43}]', 'john-fowless-fiction-and-the-poetics-of-postmodernism', 1, NULL, 2, 0, '2023-11-05 08:47:19', '2023-11-05 08:47:21'),
