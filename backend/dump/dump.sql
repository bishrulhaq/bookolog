Watson joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955 and in 1968 became director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. From 1989 to 1992 he was director of the National Center for Human Genome Research, which undertook the Human Genome Project.

As humans, are we unique or are we part of a greater cosmic existence? What is lifeÃs future on Earth and beyond? How does life begin and develop?

With todayÃs technology, however, we are closer than ever to finding the answers. Astrobiology is the relatively new, but fast growing scientific discipline that involves trying to understand the origin, evolution, and distribution of life within the universe. It is also one of the few scientific disciplines that attracts the publicÃs intense curiosity and attention. This interest stems largely from the deep personal meaning that the possible existence of extraterrestrial life has for so many.

In this broadly accessible introduction to the field, Bruce Jakosky looks at the search for life in the universe not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a distinctly social one.

The composition, structure, and processes in forest soils at any given time reflect current conditions, as well as the legacies of decades (and even millennia) of interactions that shape each forest soil. Reciprocal interactions are fundamental; vegetation alters soil physical properties, which influence soil biology and chemistry, which in turn influence the growth and success of plants. These dynamic systems may be strongly influenced by intentional and unintentional management, ranging from fire to fertilization. Sustaining the long-term fertility of forest soils depends on insights about a diverse array of soil features and changes over space and time. Since the third edition of this successful book many new interests in forest soils and their management have arisen, including the role of forest soils in sequestering carbon, and how management influences rates of carbon accumulation. This edition also expands the consideration of how soils are sampled and characterized, and how tree species differ in their influence on soil development. Clearly structured throughout, the book opens with the origins of forest soil science and ends with the application of soil science principles to land management.

The papers in this volume, however, have been influenced to no lesser extent by the advent of molecular beam epitaxy and metal/organic chemical vapor deposition which has made possible the control of semiconductor boundaries on a quantum level. This new control of boundary condi tions in ultra small electronic research is the mathematical reason for a whole set of innovative ideas. For the first time in the history of semiconductors, it is possible to design device functions from physical considerations involving ~ngstom scale dimensions. At the time the meeting was held, July 1982, it was one of the first strong signals of the powerful developments in this area. During the meeting, important questions have been answered concerning ballistic transport, Monte Carlo simulations of high field transport and other developments pertinent to new device concepts and the understanding of small devices from physics to function.

However, TH1 / TH2 paradigm could not adequately explain development of certain inflammatory responses which provided impetus for the discovery of a new subset of T cells called TH17 cells. After the discovery of differentiation and transcription factors for TH17 cells, it was clear that TH17 cells represent an independent subset of T cells with specific functions in eliminating certain extracellular pathogens, presumably not adequately handled by TH1 or TH2 cells. The major role of TH17 cells has been described in inducing auto-immune tissue inflammation. The discovery of TH17 cells has expanded the TH1 / TH2 paradigm, and the integration of TH17 cells with TH1 and TH2 effector T cells is beginning to explain the underlying mechanisms of tissue inflammation in a number of infections and auto-immune disease settings.â - From Chapter One by Vijay K.

The programs are written in BASIC and are designed to suit as wide a range of computer as possible. The book begins with a group of programs which solve several of the most common functions encountered in groundwater science. These are then developed into programs capable of calculating drawdown in a variety of discharge rate/aquifer/boundary configurations, either at one time, or a series of exponentially increasing times. The author shows how a computerised form of Newtons method (for solving difficult equations) may be applied to such tasks as evaluating storage coefficient if transmissivity is known. Lagrangian interpolation is used to produce accurate values from tabled functions, either within a program, or on demand. One of the major programs in the book may be used to enter discharge test data into a computer, edit it as required (e.g. change drawdown measurements from feet to metres, or water levels to drawdowns etc.), and finally to analyse the data. For example, three different methods are provided for evaluation of the well equation. Another program is provided for controlling a plotter to produce several popular types of discharge test graphs; and a new image well method is included for simulating boundaries consisting of straight line junctions between areas of two different transmissivities. This is a practical book, written to solve real-life problems. Accordingly, program operation is clearly described, but derivation of equations and functions have been omitted. (For those readers wishing to check on derivations, references are provided). Readers familiar with microcomputer programming may apply the programs given here to their own work, perhaps incorporating them as subroutines into large, more specialized programs.

In 1908, near Folsom, New Mexico, a cowboy discovered the remains of a herd of extinct giant bison. By examining flint points embedded in the bones, archeologists later determined that a band of humans had killed and butchered the animals 12,450 years ago. This discovery vastly expanded Americaâs known human history but also revealed the long-standing danger Homo sapiens presented to the continentâs evolutionary richness. Distinguished author Dan Floresâs ambitious history chronicles the epoch in which humans and animals have coexisted in the âwild new worldâ of North Americaâa place shaped both by its own grand evolutionary forces and by momentous arrivals from Asia, Africa, and Europe. With portraits of iconic creatures such as mammoths, horses, wolves, and bison, Flores describes the evolution and historical ecology of North America like never before. The arrival of humans precipitated an extraordinary disruption of this teeming environment. Flores treats humans not as a species apart but as a new animal entering two continents that had never seen our likes before. He shows how our long past as carnivorous hunters helped us settle America, initially establishing a coast-to-coast culture that lasted longer than the present United States. But humanityâs success had devastating consequences for other creatures. In telling this epic story, Flores traces the origins of todayâs âSixth Extinctionâ to the spread of humans around the world; tracks the story of a hundred centuries of Native America; explains how Old World ideologies precipitated 400 years of market-driven slaughter that devastated so many ancient American species; and explores the decline and miraculous recovery of species in recent decades. In thrilling narrative style, informed by genomic science, evolutionary biology, and environmental history, Flores celebrates the astonishing bestiary that arose on our continent and introduces the complex human cultures and individuals who hastened its eradication, studied Americaâs animals, and moved heaven and earth to rescue them. Eons in scope and continental in scale, Wild New World is a sweeping yet intimate Big History of the animal-human story in America.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.1.1.0.preview.2', 'en', NULL, '["Science"]', 'yGINZF1buAw', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YPVhEAAAQBAJ', 478, '"BOOK"', '132400617X', '9781324006176', 1, NULL, '["Dan Flores"]', '[{"name":"Dan Flores","key":"OL2818257A","k_id":63}]', '2023-09-26 18:39:20', '2023-09-26 18:48:14'),

In those instances in which a particular type of pollution has been recognized, three major questions usually arise: 1, How serious is the pollution? 2, Is the technology to abate it available? and 3, Do the costs of abatement justify the degree of abatement achieved? The principal intention of this series of books is to help the reader to formulate answers to the last two of the above three questions. The traditional approach of applying tried-and-true solutions to specific pollution problems has been a major factor contributing to the success of environmental engineering, and in large measure has accounted for the establishing of a "methodology of pollution control.', 'NOT_MATURE', 'preview-1.0.0', 'en', NULL, '["Science"]', 'JR6FD0NSarM', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8_aozwEACAAJ', NULL, '"BOOK"', '0896030016', '9780896030015', 1, NULL, '["Lawrence K.

Back in the 1990s - working undercover with his colleagues in the environmental movement - he would descend on trial sites of genetically modified crops at night and hack them to pieces. Two decades later, most people around the world - from New York to China - still think that \'GMO\' foods are bad for their health or likely to damage the environment. But Mark has changed his mind. This book explains why. In 2013, in a world-famous recantation speech, Mark apologised for having destroyed GM crops. He spent the subsequent years touring Africa and Asia, and working with plant scientists who are using this technology to help smallholder farmers in developing countries cope better with pests, diseases and droughts. This book lifts the lid on the anti-GMO craze and shows how science was left by the wayside as a wave of public hysteria swept the world. Mark takes us back to the origins of the technology and introduces the scientific pioneers who invented it. He explains what led him to question his earlier assumptions about GM food, and talks to both sides of this fractious debate to see what still motivates worldwide opposition today. In the process he asks - and answers - the killer question: how did we all get it so wrong on GMOs?\'An important contribution to an issue with enormous potential for benefiting humanity.\' Stephen Pinker\'I warmly recommend it.\' Philip Pullman', 'NOT_MATURE', '0.0.1.0.preview.0', 'en', NULL, '["NATURE"]', 'L01Zz6hgxVY', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CwhbEAAAQBAJ', 305, '"BOOK"', '1472946995', '9781472946997', 1, NULL, '["Mark Lynas"]', '[{"name":"Mark Lynas","key":"OL1416934A","k_id":83}]', '2023-09-26 18:39:25', '2023-09-26 18:48:48'),

The study contributes to literature on UA, sustainability, and urban geography through examining the ability of marginalized communities to compete for land on which to grow produce in contribution to their food security, livelihoods, communities, and environments, and will be of interest to UA practitioners, students, and scholars of geography, sociology, sustainability studies, environmental studies, and food studies. This project is distinctive for its global - local orientation that uses local cases to shed light on global phenomena relating to sustainability, neoliberalism, and policy mobilities. It is also important for its qualitative approach to understanding the perceived value of UA. Throughout the research, stakeholders emphasized the qualitative values of UA (such as social integration for new immigrants) that are not easily captured in statistical representations of the economic value of a given piece of urban land.

Watson, then just twentyfour, helped launch the greatest ongoing scientific quest of our time. Now, with unique authority and sweeping vision, he gives us the first full account of the genetic revolutionâfrom Mendelâs garden to the double helix to the sequencing of the human genome and beyond. Watsonâs lively, panoramic narrative begins with the fanciful speculations of the ancients as to why âlike begets likeâ before skipping ahead to 1866, when an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first deduced the basic laws of inheritance. But genetics as we recognize it todayâwith its capacity, both thrilling and sobering, to manipulate the very essence of living thingsâcame into being only with the rise of molecular investigations culminating in the breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA, for which Watson shared a Nobel prize in 1962. In the DNA moleculeâs graceful curves was the key to a whole new science. Having shown that the secret of life is chemical, modern genetics has set mankind off on a journey unimaginable just a few decades ago. Watson provides the general reader with clear explanations of molecular processes and emerging technologies. He shows us how DNA continues to alter our understanding of human origins, and of our identities as groups and as individuals. And with the insight of one who has remained close to every advance in research since the double helix, he reveals how genetics has unleashed a wealth of possibilities to alter the human conditionâfrom genetically modified foods to genetically modified babiesâand transformed itself from a domain of pure research into one of big business as well. It is a sometimes topsy-turvy world full of great minds and great egos, driven by ambitions to improve the human condition as well as to improve investment portfolios, a world vividly captured in these pages. Facing a future of choices and social and ethical implications of which we dare not remain uninformed, we could have no better guide than James Watson, who leads us with the same bravura storytelling that made The Double Helix one of the most successful books on science ever published. Infused with a scientistâs awe at natureâs marvels and a humanistâs profound sympathies, DNA is destined to become the classic telling of the defining scientific saga of our age.', 'NOT_MATURE', '1.5.2.0.preview.2', 'en', NULL, '["Science"]', 'S43HDzeuq74', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/q_ogPf96O28C', 464, '"BOOK"', '0307521486', '9780307521484', 1, NULL, '["James D.

A brand new syndrome, Meester Loeys syndrome carrying the name of Bart Loeys was added as a companion to Loeys-Dietz syndrome.

It considers the ways in which climate changes and modifications in land cover may change the environment in coming decades. Thoroughly revised to cover the remarkable transformation in interest that humans are having in the environment, this book examines previously uncovered topics, such as rewilding, ecosystem services, techniques for study, novel and no analogue ecosystems, and more. It also presents the latest views on big themes such as human origins, the anthropocene, domestication, extinctions, and ecological invasions. Extensively re-written, Human Impact on the Natural Environment, Eighth Edition contains many new and updated statistical tables, figures, and references. It offers enlightening chapters that look at the past and present state of the worldâexamining our impact on the land itself and the creatures that inhabit it; the oceans, lakes, rivers and streams; and the climate and atmosphere. The book also takes a deep look at our future impact on the planet and its resourcesâour affect on the coastal environments, the cryosphere and the drylands, as well as the hydrological and geomorphological impacts. Fully updated to take account of recent advances in our understanding of global warming and other phenomena Offers current opinions on such topics as human origins, the anthropocene, domestication, extinctions, and ecological invasions Features a full-color presentation to allow for more and clearer photographs and diagrams Contains more international case studies than previous editions to balance UK examples Human Impact on the Natural Environment is essential reading for undergraduates in geography and environmental science, and for those who want a thorough, wide-ranging and balanced overview of the impacts of humans upon natural processes and systems from the Stone Age to the Anthropocene and who wish to understand the major environmental issues that concern the human race at the present time.', 'NOT_MATURE', 'preview-1.0.0', 'en', NULL, '["Computers"]', 'rXkBf8uKnXQ', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/QvRgDwAAQBAJ', 472, '"BOOK"', '1119403731', '9781119403739', 1, NULL, '["Andrew S.

Various aspects of transport security have already been analysed under different agendas. Some research was focused on the potential risk to the environment resulting from transport, in particular from the transport of hazardous or dangerous goods, while other research considered critical elements of transport networks or supply chains as vital lifelines in the case of natural disasters. Recently, new threats stimulated interest in transport security as a stand-alone issue, placing it at the forefront of political and academic agendas. A NATO Advanced Research Workshop held at Imperial College London in January 2009 brought together those with expertise in the above-mentioned fields in order to verify the current state of knowledge in the field and identify promising areas for future work. The workshop concentrated on maritime and intermodal transport, risk management and long-term strategic planning, rather than on the details of monitoring or detection techniques. This collection of papers emanates largely from that workshop. While transport systems are widely recognized as terrorist targets, complete protection of these systems is economically and practically infeasible.

Such forests are likely to be managed not only for timber production but also for recreation and to enhance biodiversity. An introductory chapter describes how forests have been transformed by exploitation and management and how altering the composition and distribution of forests can contribute to pest problems. Subsequent chapters focus on the \'techniques\' of management and control that contribute to IPM, considering in turn plant health, risk-rating, silviculture, tree resistance, biological control, microbial control and semiochemicals. By focussing on these important elements of management, the aim is to provide a critical analysis of the theory and practice of each one in relation to key aspects of both pest and forest ecology. The final chapter on IPM brings together elements of the previous chapters, discussing them in the context of the economic and environmental impact of pests, the economics of control, and the role of decision support systems.
